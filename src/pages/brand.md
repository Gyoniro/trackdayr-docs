# Brand

TrackDayR brand assets and usage guidelines.

## Trademark Usage Agreement

The TrackDayR name and logos are trademarks of MadCow S.r.l.

You may not use the TrackDayR name or logos in any way that could mistakenly imply any official connection with or
endorsement of MadCow S.r.l.

Any use of the TrackDayR name or logos in a manner that could cause customer confusion is not permitted.

This includes naming a product or service in a way that emphasizes the TrackDayR brand, like “TrackDayR Mods”, as
well as in domain names like “trackdayrmods.com”.

Instead, you must use your own brand name in a way that clearly distinguishes it from TrackDayR. Examples that are
permitted include “ModdingGroupName: Mods for TrackDayR”.

Additionally, you may not use our trademarks for t-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise without explicit written
consent.

## Assets

These assets are provided for use in situations like articles, video tutorials and gameplay or mods making (like in
banners). They should not be used in any way that could be confusing for customers or imply any affiliation with MadCow
S.r.l.
